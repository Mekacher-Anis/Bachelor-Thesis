	title = {Object Detection with Discriminatively Trained Part Based Models},
	abstract = {We describe an object detection system based on mixtures of multiscale deformable part models. Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the {PASCAL} object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difﬁcult benchmarks such as the {PASCAL} datasets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a marginsensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent {SVM}. A latent {SVM} is a reformulation of {MI}-{SVM} in terms of latent variables. A latent {SVM} is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is speciﬁed for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between ﬁxing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent {SVM} objective function.},

	abstract = {We study the question of feature sets for robust visual object recognition, adopting linear {SVM} based human detection as a test case. After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of Histograms of Oriented Gradient ({HOG}) descriptors signiﬁcantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the inﬂuence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that ﬁne-scale gradients, ﬁne orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original {MIT} pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICCV.1999.790410},
	abstract = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and afﬁne or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efﬁciently detected through a staged ﬁltering approach that identiﬁes stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest-neighbor indexing method that identiﬁes candidate object matches. Final veriﬁcation of each match is achieved by ﬁnding a low-residual least-squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially-occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds.},

	abstract = {Text detection and recognition, which is also known as optical character recognition ({OCR}), is an active research area under quick development with a lot of exciting applications. Deep-learning-based methods represent the state-of-art of this area. However, these methods are largely deterministic: they give a deterministic output for each input. For both statisticians and general users, methods supporting uncertainty inference are of great appeal, leaving rich research opportunities to incorporate statistical models and methods with the established deep-learning-based approaches. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the evolution history of research development on {OCR} with discussions on the statistical insights behind these developments and potential directions to enhance the current methods with statistical approaches. We hope this article can serve as a useful guidebook for statisticians who are seeking for a path toward edge-cutting research in this exciting area.

	volume = {1},
	doi = {10.1109/CVPR.2001.990517},
	abstract = {This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "integral image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on {AdaBoost}, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},
