\chapter*{Abstract}
Education, like many other fields, has seen a massive move toward digitization, and this progress was amplified as the COVID-19 virus hit and all students were forced to attend online lectures. This sudden switch to online courses meant hundreds of hours of unlabeled video lectures got uploaded to online learning platforms. This thesis focuses on labeling these videos by extracting written text from videos. The extracted text can then be used to implement content-based search in lecture video datasets.
