\chapter*{Abstract}
Education, like many other fields, has seen a massive move toward digitization, and with it, hundreds of hours of unlabeled video lectures got uploaded to online learning platforms. This thesis focuses on labeling these videos by extracting written text from them. We suggest an Optical Character Recognition video-processing pipeline integrating state-of-the-art text localization and recognition methods to transcribe text efficiently. The performance of different text localization and recognition methods is compared with the help of an appropriate dataset. The extracted text can then be used to implement content-based search in lecture video datasets.
